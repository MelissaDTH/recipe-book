# 📖 🍋 Recipe Book 🍋 📖

Welcome to the **Recipe Book** project!
The Recipe Book project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for managing recipes. Whether you're a home cook, a food enthusiast, or someone looking to organize family recipes, this app will help you keep track of your culinary creations in one place. I found managing recipes in my phone’s notes app challenging, as it often made them difficult to read and update. To address this, I decided to build my own app that allows for easy and intuitive recipe management, making it simpler to organize.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed language that builds on JavaScript, adding type safety and improving code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly and efficiently (to be implemented)
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server that provides a modern and efficient development experience.
